# rage

Visual representations of ClojureScript Abstract Syntax Trees, in the browser.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to have a graphical representation of the AST of any ClojureScript code.

As it stands, you can view the pretty-printed text version of the AST alongside your code.

Milestones:
1. Change the textarea to an actual code editor.
2. Come up with a graphical way to represent ClojureScript ASTs.
3. Add a canvas pane with drag/drop, zoom in/out.
4. Move the textual AST to the bottom left, change the right pane to be the graphical AST.

## Setup
